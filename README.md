# Useful Smart Contracts

This repository contains examples of tested gas efficient smart contracts, demonstrating best practices and
basic ideas to implement DApps. For example 

- 'Proxy Contracts' can be used to deploy any smart contract, and execute its functions, dynamically.
- 'MultiSigWallet' is simple example where multiple owners need to approve transaction, before execution
- 'DutchAuction' is where price of the nft decreases by time, to a certain limit
- 'AccessControl' is where you want to define custom roles in your smart contract
- 'Kill' shows example of deleting smart contract. Surprised? :)


I tried to use best practices in these examples. More examples are on the way :)
